# Fourier Tree Growing Implementation

This repository provides a implementation of Fourier Tree Growing (FTG) in Python. 
FTG is a pioneering approach to symbolic regression by considering functional analyis for optimization. 
The symbolic regression problem is reformulated and the optimization process is performed in Hilbert space. 
FTG uses a Gram matrix to retransform the considered ideal solution back into symbolic space.
